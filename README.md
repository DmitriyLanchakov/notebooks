Tkinter is a portable GUI toolkit for Python. It enables rapid development of GUI applications.

Tkinter itself is a Python 'layer' between you and Tk, which provides all the graphical 'widgets'. See [How Tk and Tkinter are Related](http://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html#how-tk-and-tkinter-are-related) for some idea of how it all works.
